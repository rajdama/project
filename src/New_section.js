          As described in its name, invisible disabilities are disabilities that are not immediately apparent.
Deafness, Hearing loss, mutism, dyslexia, and ADHD are some examples of invisible disabilities. 
Since they are “invisible,” others fail to understand or acknowledge their existence of the disability. Our project aims at inclusive education.
